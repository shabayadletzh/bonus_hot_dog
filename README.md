# Hot Dog not Hot Dog Assignment

## Adilet Shabay

In this assignment, we developed and deployed a computer vision web application using Streamlit that serves as an interface for real-time image classification. Our code handles the end-to-end pipeline, accepting user-uploaded images, preprocessing the data, and passing it through a machine learning model to generate predictions. To solve the "Jinyang's app" problem—where the original software was a limited binary classifier that could only distinguish between "Hot Dog" and "Not Hot Dog"—we upgraded the system to a multi-class classification architecture. By leveraging a comprehensive Hugging Face dataset containing labeled images of diverse food categories, we expanded the model's vocabulary to recognize specific dishes like dumplings and noodles, effectively transforming a restricted gag tool into a highly functional and versatile application.
